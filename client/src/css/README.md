# SCSS (styles) directory

This directory should contain CSS not associated with any one specific entry point or component. This could include core CSS utilities or global resets.

NOTE: None of the classes/styles contained in this directory will be localized via CSS modules! All of this CSS is in the global "namespace", so be as careful with your naming as you would with normal CSS.

## Style linting

There is a linter! Listen to it! Docs are [here](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint). Also, the existing linter config is only a sensible set of defaults; the front-end lead should feel free add to the config as the project requires.
